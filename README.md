### Demo info

This repo contains code for **XeroLinux Demos**. These ISOs are for exploring only, since they come without an installer and space is pretty limited. Great for checking out what the distro can do and experimenting with the setup before making a donation. A solid way to tinker, see the tweaks in action, and dive into the details without any commitment.

**Build Instructions**

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-demo
cd xero-demo/ && ./build.sh
```

That's it. You will find ISOs inside `XeroISO/SpinName`

Thanks for the support. ❤️‍🔥
